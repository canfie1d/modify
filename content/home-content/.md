intro: >-
  We welcome booking appointments with new customers by phone. Although we do
  accept walk-ins, it is always best to make an appointment in advance for best
  availability. If you already know your stylist, feel free to contact them
  directly to book an appointment. Individual service price lists, as well as
  contact information can be found on the stylistâ€™s page.
