bio: >-
  Arizona native recently transplanted to the beautiful Pacific Northwest! I
  graduated from Brillare Hairdressing Academy in 2012, where I had the
  privilege to learn from some of Arizona's top stylists. I immediately found my
  home at a busy Aveda salon in Tempe, Arizona, where I worked my way up to earn
  the title of Senior Stylist and Educator. While at Mood Swings Salon, I had
  the opportunity to refine my craft and learn new techniques from numerous
  successful stylists.

  I am excited to settle into my new home here in the Wallingford neighborhood,
  and to fill my chair with beautiful smiling faces! I specialize in short
  women's cuts, men's scissor cuts, balayage, and blondes! I see each guest
  based on personal style, hair type and lifestyle. I would love to get to know
  you and make you look and feel your absolute best!
